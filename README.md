# What is Sintoburi?
Our project is to help sellers that have to earn money in the traditional market by introducing embedded software. **Sintoburi** means that the body and the land where one is born are one, not two. It means that the things that came from the land where you were born are better suited to your body.

# Background
In order to revitalize the traditional market, we are going to introduce a more modernized traditional market help system. Despite the fact that the current traditional market has a lot of delicious fruits compared to large-sized marts, it has not been able to effectively promote the information of the market to the customers of the market. I would like to develop a traditional market helper system that can solve these problems and make it possible to revitalize the traditional market which is losing market competitiveness. 

Market factors that impede the activation of traditional markets. And then draw out ideas for solving the problems. Investigate through the internet site what technologies are needed to introduce the ideas actually brought into the traditional market. The hardware and software programming languages are organized to actually implement the investigated technologies. Realize the designed software to actualize experiment and perfection. We visited the below traditional markets to survey weak point of that.

# Design

It is to explain our design about helping the traditional market. Using our products in traditional markets, we can digitize traditional markets. This product is designed to activate and differentiate traditional markets in line with the fourth industrial revolution. And to develop IOT products that automatically promote market information to customers visiting the market.
This product can be used only with mobile phone. The product screen shows discounts according to each hour. 

Web programs for uploading php files require php and html. The raspberry pie board cost 50,000 won, and the OS uses the ubuntu OS which does not cost money. At the entrance of the market, a motion sensor called the pir sensor of the product detects customers and informs you of today's discounts.The ad monitor will notify you of the following events, such as "Please come tomorrow because there is a special event for tomorrow".The effect of this product is digitization of the market, automation of the promotion of the shop is possible, so there are regular customers, and the profit of the shop owners increases.Therefore, we can revitalize the traditional market.

**Lim Hyun-jun** is responsible for the hardware development area. **Lim Soo-yeon** is responsible for software development such as web application. In order to effectively share opinions and communicate smoothly, the development site, which is responsible for each of them, must be defective at the end. Through the recent popular github.com development hosting site, it is possible to share the progress of each development role in real time, We plan to increase the completeness of the works by collaborating.
