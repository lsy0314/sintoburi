# Background
In order to revitalize the traditional market, we are going to introduce a more modernized traditional market help system. Despite the fact that the current traditional market has a lot of delicious fruits compared to large-sized marts, it has not been able to effectively promote the information of the market to the customers of the market. I would like to develop a traditional market helper system that can solve these problems and make it possible to revitalize the traditional market which is losing market competitiveness. 

Market factors that impede the activation of traditional markets. And then draw out ideas for solving the problems. Investigate through the internet site what technologies are needed to introduce the ideas actually brought into the traditional market. The hardware and software programming languages are organized to actually implement the investigated technologies. Realize the designed software to actualize experiment and perfection. We visited the below traditional markets to survey weak point of that.

# Introduction
We made Youtube video to introduce our proposal. This video will be played for 3 minutes.

It is a team of Shintoism. Let me explain about helping the traditional market. Using our products in traditional markets, we can digitize traditional markets. This product is designed to activate and differentiate traditional markets in line with the fourth industrial revolution. And to develop IOT products that automatically promote market information to customers visiting the market.
This product can be used only with mobile phone. The product screen shows discounts according to each hour. 

Web programs for uploading php files require php and html. The raspberry pie board cost 50,000 won, and the OS uses the ubuntu OS which does not cost money. At the entrance of the market, a motion sensor called the pir sensor of the product detects customers and informs you of today's discounts.The ad monitor will notify you of the following events, such as "Please come tomorrow because there is a special event for tomorrow".The effect of this product is digitization of the market, automation of the promotion of the shop is possible, so there are regular customers, and the profit of the shop owners increases.Therefore, we can revitalize the traditional market.


# How to solve problem

## What part of the traditional (traditional) market do you want to improve?
Traditionally, traditional markets are not able to promote customers who come to the market effectively, even if they have good food or discounted food. Some foods have a system that automatically and systematically notifies these events even if the traditional market is discounted at a much lower price than the large mart. To solve these problems, we intend to make a product that activates the so-called traditional market that manages and promotes traditional events or events using embedded devices automatically.


## What software to use for development?
We plan to use the Python language to develop motion sensor-based software that customers can detect when entering traditional markets. And the store owners plan to develop web applications using php language and html language to upload and manage voice files recorded on their mobile phones. Since I have been studying C language before, I understand the python, php, html language necessary for the work development to listen to the video education course which is guided through the YouTube site. To learn the grammar and examples necessary for the development of the works, minimize the learning time required for development.


## What materials and hardware will be used for development?
We will purchase the raspberry pie board, an affordable affordable embedded device for configuring the hardware environment. We will also integrate a raspberry board with a built-in 7-inch touchscreen monitor to show customers useful information. We will purchase a low cost motion sensor called PIR (Passive Infrared) to detect movement of users. In addition, we will purchase the sound devices necessary to play the audio files of the recorded store properly at the point of time when the market visitor's visit is sensed. These hardware costs, which are required to be retrieved from an internet site, can be purchased for a total of 60,000 won or less.

## What do we have to consider in advance before starting this project?
In order to minimize the expense required to introduce the proposed system, we will find a way to actually construct the system using low - cost embedded devices.The OS for running a web application is free and open source, and Ubuntu, which is open to the world, is used to develop the software purchase cost in a way that it does not need. We will not choose Windows to develop our ideas so. Instead, they decided to adopt the free open source Linux-based Ubuntu OS. At this time, the way to mount the Ubuntu OS on the embedded board called Raspberry Pie will proceed to prepare the basic hardware configuration works to operate using the SD card.


# Team members
Lim Hyun-jun is responsible for the hardware development area. Lim Soo-yeon is responsible for software development. In order to effectively share opinions and communicate smoothly, the development site, which is responsible for each of them, must be defective at the end. Through the recent popular github.com development hosting site, it is possible to share the progress of each development role in real time, We plan to increase the completeness of the works by collaborating.
