## What part of the traditional (traditional) market do you want to improve?
Traditionally, traditional markets are not able to promote customers who come to the market effectively, even if they have good food or discounted food. Some foods have a system that automatically and systematically notifies these events even if the traditional market is discounted at a much lower price than the large mart. To solve these problems, we intend to make a product that activates the so-called traditional market that manages and promotes traditional events or events using embedded devices automatically.


## What software to use for development?
We plan to use the Python language to develop motion sensor-based software that customers can detect when entering traditional markets. And the store owners plan to develop web applications using php language and html language to upload and manage voice files recorded on their mobile phones. Since I have been studying C language before, I understand the python, php, html language necessary for the work development to listen to the video education course which is guided through the YouTube site. To learn the grammar and examples necessary for the development of the works, minimize the learning time required for development.


## What materials and hardware will be used for development?
We will purchase the raspberry pie board, an affordable affordable embedded device for configuring the hardware environment. We will also integrate a raspberry board with a built-in 7-inch touchscreen monitor to show customers useful information. We will purchase a low cost motion sensor called PIR (Passive Infrared) to detect movement of users. In addition, we will purchase the sound devices necessary to play the audio files of the recorded store properly at the point of time when the market visitor's visit is sensed. These hardware costs, which are required to be retrieved from an internet site, can be purchased for a total of 60,000 won or less.

## What do we have to consider in advance before starting this project?
In order to minimize the expense required to introduce the proposed system, we will find a way to actually construct the system using low - cost embedded devices.The OS for running a web application is free and open source, and Ubuntu, which is open to the world, is used to develop the software purchase cost in a way that it does not need. We will not choose Windows to develop our ideas so. Instead, they decided to adopt the free open source Linux-based Ubuntu OS. At this time, the way to mount the Ubuntu OS on the embedded board called Raspberry Pie will proceed to prepare the basic hardware configuration works to operate using the SD card.
